{"name":"Euregio Tech Community","tagline":"","body":"#Euregio Tech Community\r\nThe Euregio Tech Community is a platform for and run by tech-professionals, -students and -companies \r\nin the Euregio, the region that connects Belgium, Netherlands and Germany. We bridge the gap between \r\nvarious local initiatives and aim to be a connector in the region to improve collaboration across \r\nborders and spawn new projects. In collaborating across borders we seek to leverage the region's full\r\npotential. We aspire to be a community that helps each other, that is proud to produce services made \r\nin the Euregio and is proud to provide knowledge to peers. Through this we want to foster local \r\nentrepreneurship in the region, avoid the brain-drain of high-potential leaving the region and become\r\nan integral part of the local economy.        \r\n\r\n\r\n##Euregio Events, Academy & Mentoring\r\nWe hold regular monthly workshops about dedicated tech and adjacent topics. Within this format we \r\nbenefit from our own network's expertise as we try to seek out topics where one of our members is \r\nan expert in. Therefore, we diffuse knowledge, make it more transparent and improve individual \r\nproject by providing technology best practices. \r\n\r\nWhile monthly workshops provide best practices in the technology sector, the quarter-annual \r\nWeb, Wurst, Waffles and Windmills event provides a platform for experienced entrepreneurs to share \r\ntheir experience, new startups get pitch to pitch their business idea and local investors are able\r\nto find new companies to invest in. With these events we aim to provide role models for local \r\nentrepreneurs and starters and a solid foundation to start a business.\r\n\r\nLocal entrepreneurship clubs, such as AC.E. e.V. in Aachen, provide the local support infrastructure\r\nfor day-to-day activities and provide guidance for starters through mentorship, pitch workshops, and\r\naccess to early stage investors and accelerators. Through this setup we aim to embed startups into local\r\nnetworks as soon as possible to let them leverage on the existing support infrastructure.\r\n\r\n##Support projects:\r\nTo supplement the above mentioned events, we are building up necessary infrastructure for starters and\r\nsmall and medium sized enterprises in Euregio. The following activities aim to provide a nurturing \r\nground for new ventures:\r\n\r\n###Euregio Co-working alliance\r\nProjects and startups require office space according to their respective development stage. With\r\nthe alliance we provide a platform to accompany the respective needs of these projects. From providing a\r\n*launchpad* for early stage startups, to medium size co-working spaces up until flexible office spaces\r\nfor more matured companies. We leverage our network of professionals to provide a transparent platform \r\nfor individuals and teams to work anywhere they want in the region. Free of borders, and free of overhead.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Euregio Job Platform\r\nWe strive to create a job platform for all qualification levels. Internships for students, entry level\r\njobs for graduates and a network for experts as well as freelancers. We understand that a crucial element\r\nfor companies to succeed is access to a talent pool. Yet, a lot of talented potential employees leave the \r\nEuregio. Our platform aims to remedy that issue. By increasing cross-border transparency for potential\r\njobs we want to keep talent in the area.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Euregio Network of support services\r\nBesides focussing on technology, young companies require tax, legal and adminstrative advice. Based on \r\nthe rich experience of our members we are able to provide proven, i.e. certified, contacts that are \r\nable to provide these services. This part of the platform ensures that tech projects create new \r\nopportunities for support services and young tech companies can benefit from knowledge of professionals\r\ntrusted by other peers in the Euregio network.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre you curious about our activities or do you want to join and participate in the community, feel free\r\nto enlist your company via http://www.madeineuregio.com, participate in our meetups via \r\nhttp://www.eutm.eu or contact us via hello@madeineuregio.com . \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
